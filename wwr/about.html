            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2025, our white water rafting company was born out of a passion for adventure, nature, and community. What started as a small dream between a group of outdoor enthusiasts quickly turned into a bold vision: to create a rafting experience that blends thrill, safety, and unforgettable moments on the river.

We launched our very first rafting trips on the [Insert River Name] with just two rafts and a crew of five, committed to providing high-quality, guided rafting tours for beginners and thrill-seekers alike. With a strong focus on professionalism, customer experience, and environmental respect, our trips gained popularity fast, turning first-time visitors into lifelong adventurers.

Since our founding year, we’ve grown steadily—expanding our fleet, training more expert guides, and adding customized group packages, including corporate team-building, school excursions, and eco-tourism experiences. We are proud to serve hundreds of guests each season, many of whom return year after year.

From our humble beginnings to where we are today, our mission remains the same:
To connect people with the wild beauty of our rivers through safe, fun, and unforgettable rafting adventures.</p>
